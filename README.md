This thesis is a literature review that investigates the impact of government policy responses to
COVID-19 in Vietnam. I analyze fiscal and monetary policies implemented by the government of
Vietnam, accounting for both their benefits and drawbacks. Overall, economic policy responses
implemented during the pandemic have a positive impact on the economy, but they also induce
some negative effects. While results refer to the effects of these policies on the overall economy
and some sectors, more research into their mechanism, sector-specific impacts, and their unwanted
consequences on the economy is necessary for future crisis handling. I also discuss some possible
suggestions on how to mitigate the downsides of these policies. Studying Vietnam offers valuable
insights into how a developing nation with limited resources dealt with the pandemic and how other
similar countries can improve their situation by learning from the experiences of Vietnam.
